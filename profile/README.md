## [MLX Swift Chat: Run LLM models locally with MLX!](https://github.com/preternatural-explore/mlx-swift-chat)
This project is a fully native SwiftUI app that allows you to run local LLMs (e.g. Llama, Mistral) on Apple silicon in real-time using MLX.

## [Movie Search: Semantic search for movies using text-embeddings.](https://github.com/preternatural-explore/AIMovieSearch)
The MovieSearch app enables users to search for movies using natural language queries, providing a more intuitive and efficient search experience. This app demonstrates working with the OpenAI API, structuring training data, implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and using text embeddings to add semantic search to any application.

## [Voice Recorder: Transcribe your voice recordings with Whisper.](https://github.com/preternatural-explore/VoicePilot)
VoicePilot demonstrates how to enhance the recording experience by not only capturing audio but also offering intelligent transcription and analysis. Upon creating a recording, VoicePilot utilizes OpenAIâ€™s Whisper API to deliver precise transcriptions, complete with timestamped segments for easy navigation. Moreover, it automatically generates a descriptive name, a concise summary, and highlights the key points for each recording, streamlining the customerâ€™s review process and making information retrieval straightforward.

## [Poem Generator: Personalized poetry, anytime, any topic!](https://github.com/preternatural-explore/PoemWriter)
PoemWriter is a simple demonstration of the LLM completions API. The user enters a poem topic and the LLM generates a full poem about the topic. Here is a poem generated for WWDC!

## [Narrator Bot: Transform Image into Audio]([https://github.com/preternatural-explore/NarratorBot](https://github.com/preternatural-explore/narrator-bot))
A bot that narrates what it sees in front of it, in the style of a BBC nature documentary with the voice of Sir David Attenborough. Uses GPT-4o for image understanding and ElevenLabs for Audio Generation.
