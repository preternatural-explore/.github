## [AIMovieSearch: AI-Powered Movie Search App](https://github.com/preternatural-explore/AIMovieSearch)
The AIMovieSearch app is an example of how to add AI-powered search to any application. This app demonstrates key concepts such as working with the OpenAI API, structuring training data, utilizing text embeddings, and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By leveraging advanced AI techniques, the AIMovieSearch app enables users to search for movies using natural language queries, providing a more intuitive and efficient search experience.

## [VoicePilot: An AI-Powered Voice Recorder](https://github.com/preternatural-explore/VoicePilot)
VoicePilot demonstrates how to enhance the recording experience by not only capturing audio but also offering intelligent transcription and analysis. Upon creating a recording, VoicePilot utilizes OpenAIâ€™s Whisper API to deliver precise transcriptions, complete with timestamped segments for easy navigation. Moreover, it automatically generates a descriptive name, a concise summary, and highlights the key points for each recording, streamlining the customerâ€™s review process and making information retrieval straightforward.
